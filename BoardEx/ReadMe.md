# Sample 1
* The sample is of all options awarded between 1999 and 2020.
* Includes option packages whose expiration dates are beyond 2020.

# Sample 2
* The sample is of all options awarded between 1999 and 2020.
* All options expire before 2021.

# Sample 3 
* Merged BoardEx and ExecuComp datasets -- 15,000+ executives
* Can see the aggregate number of options executive spent each year.
* Options vesting beyond 2021 included.
* I don't look at the "spread out" and "median" option exercising assumptions from the previous samples.

# Sample 4
* Merged BoardEx and ExecuComp datasets but keep those whose start off with zero options.
* Can see the aggregate number of options executive spent each year.
* Options vesting beyond 2021 included.
* I don't look at the "spread out" and "median" option exercising assumptions from the previous samples.

## What am I doing here?
The idea of this sample is to take the merged dataset and restrict it to people who start accumulating options within the sample time frame (1999-2020). I have a problem in that BoardEx stops interviewing people who continue on in BoardEx. There is no way for me to distinguish if BoardEx stops collecting data on an individual. 

This sample is much smaller than Sample 3 for the following reasons:
1. Some executives arrive in an earlier year in ExecuComp and in a later year in BoardEx. 
2. Some executives appear in Execucomp already with an initial stock of options (so we have no clue where they came from).
